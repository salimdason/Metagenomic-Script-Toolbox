# Metagenomic-Script-Toolbox
A collection of scripts for metagenomic analysis


Pipeline_Script.py assumes you already have the following installed:
1.metaspades, 2.bowtie2, 3.seqtk, 4.samtools, 5.jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths, 6.metabat 2, already insatlled and added to your path variable. 

Also ensure to make sure the only files present in the directory are your paired-end reads, and the script.
